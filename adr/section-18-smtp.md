# SMTP Services

## Context

For real-life applications, self-hosting SMTP servers is not usually a viable 
alternative. Instead, there are multiple different paid services.

For this course, we'll be using [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) because there
is a free tier and it is enough for a course.

A paid solution would be `Mailgun`, but we are not willing to spend money now.
